My daughter was on a private rowing team in buffalo and always came to Saratoga for regattas.  Unfortunately, she was  always busy at the water so she never saw much of Saratoga.  For my daughters birthday I took her on ‚ÄúA Mystery Birthday Ride‚Äù to Saratoga. She didn‚Äôt figure it out where she I was taking her until we turned on to Broadway.  To say she was thrilled is an understatement!  Then when we checked in at your hotel and she found a birthday cake in our room she was in shock.  Her exact words were.... I‚Äôm blown away that this by hotel and , that they gave me a birthday cake!!!  I can‚Äôt thank you enough for helping me make this weekend the BEST 27th birthday .  When we walked in and out of the quaint stores on Broadway every so often she would turn to me and say ... I‚Äôm still in shock we are here and I got a cake.  Just watching her glow with such a smile made MY time in Saratoga extra special!  Thank you from the bottom of my heart .\\nSincerely, Sue & Bri Reinecke ',\n",
